# Analysis and Modeling of Multivariate Nuclear Power Plant data using VARMA and LSTM

Accurate modeling and simulation of a power plant are important factors in strategic planning and maintenance of the system. Several non-linearities and multivariable couplings are associated with real world plants. Therefore, it becomes almost impossible to model the system using conventional mathematical equations. Statistical models such as ARIMA, ARMA are potential solutions but their linear nature cannot very well ﬁt a system with non-linear relationships between its parameters. Therefore, in such cases, VARMA (Vectored ARMA) model becomes the key candidate for multivariate time series forecasting. Recently, deep learning methods such as Artiﬁcial Neural Networks have been extensively applied for time series forecasting. In this project, we thoroughly discuss the implementation of a key architecture of neural networks, Long Short-Term Neural Networks (LSTMs). LSTM has the ability to capture nonlinear relationships in a dynamic system using its memory connections. This further helps them to overcome the issue of back-propagated error decay through memory blocks. The objective of this study is to examine the feasibility of LSTMs and VARMA models in modelling of Nuclear Power Plant and predicting the system parameters such as Reactor Temperature based on past information.
